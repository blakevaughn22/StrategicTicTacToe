Welcome to strategic tic tac toe!!!

How to play:

The idea of the game is similar to normal tic tac toe, but to win, you must win 3 boards in a row,
column or diagonally. Each board behaves the same way normal tic tac toe does, with 3 squares in 
a row, column, or diagonal, winning. When a board is won, it changes color based upon which player won;
if player X wins, it will turn red, and if player O wins, it will turn blue. If a board is drawn, it 
will turn green. 

When a sqaure is played, the next board that will be enabled will be the same relative position as the
square to the board it was played on. For example, if you played the top-right square in the middle board
as your first move, the next board that will be played will be the top-right board. If the next board 
that should be enabled is a board that has been won or drawn, it will enable all other non-finished boards
to be played on the next turm
